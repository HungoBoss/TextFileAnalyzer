# Text File Analyzer
-----------
This simple WPF App was created as my semestral project in college course of C#/.NET. It allows user to select folder containing text files and then it displays statistical information like number of words/sentences, longest/shortest word/sentence, most occured word aso. (in each file and folder).

My project uses MVVM design pattern which separates UI (View) from business logic behind the app. App is customized but I would like to add more styles in the future. In future I plan on adding unit tests both for business logic and UI.
